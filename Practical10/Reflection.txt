The practical is a littlr hard for me.
In the first two tasks, it' hard to make how the loops run and how the list for the three popilation change clear.
In the third task, it's a little confusing at first, but the given code help me a lot to understand.
What I enjoyed more is the second task.
I spent a lot time asking the assistant, talking with the classmates and checking the wrong points in the code.
Finally when I finished, I felt relieved and accomplished.
The most important thing I learned is how to draw pictures in the loops and track the change of numbers in the loops.
I think this will be quite useful in the further study.
