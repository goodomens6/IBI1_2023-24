This pratical is a little hard for me because I had no programming experience.
I can't use the commands skillfully but I improve a lot after this pratical.
I faced many difficulties.
So I learned many methods and tried many times.
Finally, I solved them.
It gives me a sense of accomplishment.
I learn a lot from this active learning.
Now I really know what all this commands do clearly.
